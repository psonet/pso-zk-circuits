//! Backend-agnostic ZK circuit abstractions.
//!
//! These traits used to live in `pso-zk-core` alongside the witness
//! types. The witness types moved into `pso-protocol` during the
//! consensus-binding extraction; the backend traits stayed in the
//! circuit repo because they describe how a Noir-style backend
//! produces and verifies proofs, which is not a consensus concern.
//!
//! Today this crate is the only backend implementation. If a second
//! one ever lands (e.g. Plonky3, Halo2), promote this module into its
//! own crate and depend on it from both.
